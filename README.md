1.Netflix Content Analysis Project Summary
This project aims to help Netflix make better business decisions by analyzing the content in its library.

2.The Problem
Netflix is a huge global streaming platform, but it faces tough competition from services like Amazon Prime and Disney+. The main goal of this project is to analyze the content Netflix offers, which we call 'Content Trends Analysis for Strategic Recommendations'. We need to look at how the types of content (Movies versus TV Shows), the genres (like comedy or action), and the countries of origin have changed over the years.

3.Why It Matters
Understanding these trends is important because it highlights the balance between Movies and TV Shows, shows which genres are popular, and reveals which categories might be missing or underrepresented. The country-wise analysis is crucial for a platform that serves audiences all over the world. This information will allow Netflix to refine its plan for acquiring and producing new content, ensuring it appeals to the right viewers and stays competitive globally.

4.What We Plan To Do
We will focus on three main objectives:

Analyze the distribution of Movies versus TV Shows added each year.
Identify the most popular genres and see how their popularity has shifted over time.
Compare the contributions from different countries to the overall Netflix catalog.

5.What We Expect to Find
The final outcome will be:

A clear understanding of how Netflix's content strategy has developed.
An identification of the best-performing genres and content categories.
Strategic recommendations on what types of content Netflix should invest in for the future.

6.Expected Outcomes

A clear understanding of how Netflixâ€™s content strategy has evolved.
Identification of top-performing genres and categories.
Strategic recommendations on which content types Netflix should focus on in the future.
